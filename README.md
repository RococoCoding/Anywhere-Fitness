# Project 3 - Anywhere Fitness  
**Timeline**: One week  
**Tech**: React, Redux  
**Description**: Anywhere Fitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.    
**Contribution Type**: School Team Project - State management, routing, authentication
**Status**: Completed  
**Retrospective**: For my unit 3 build week project, I was responsible for managing state and connecting the front end with the back end through authenticated routes. I didn't feel very solid on Redux going into build week, so I went into planning-zilla mode. I made a flow chart and everything.

However, I learned a good lesson about communication because although I had shared my flow chart with the people working on the backend, they came back with a different implmeneation than I had been expecting. I should have gone through it with them in a zoom to clarify and make sure we were all on the same page. I ended up having to rewrite portions of my code, but it was a good learning experience and gave me a better idea of what I needed to communicate to the rest of my team next month.
