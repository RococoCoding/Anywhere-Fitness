# Project 4 - Anywhere Fitness  
**Timeline**: One week  
**Tech**: React, Redux  
**Description**: Anywhere Fitness makes it painless for Instructors and Clients alike to hold and attend Fitness classes wherever they might be held.    
**Contribution Type**: School Team Project - State management, routing, authentication  
**Status**: Completed  
**Retrospective**: For my unit 3 build week project, I was responsible for managing state and connecting the front end with the back end through authenticated routes. I didn't feel very solid on Redux going into build week, so I went into planning-zilla mode. I made a flow chart and everything.

However, I learned a good lesson about communication because the back end came back with a different implmeneation than I had been expecting. We had talked in a Zoom, but didn't get into as many details as needed. I ended up having to rewrite portions of my code, but it was a good learning experience and gave me a better idea of what I needed to communicate to the rest of my team the following month. I felt a lot better about Redux coming out of this build week, though. It reminded me a lot of trying to find my way through a hospital or large office building -- all the corridors look the same and you have no idea which wing you're in -- but once you walk through it a few times, you learn your way around.
